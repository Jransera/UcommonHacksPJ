General: We all play D&D but know that the hardest part is finding friends who's schedules all line up with yours, therefore we built a google home app to play with you. The biggest challenge we faced is that the google home mini is not very developer friendly.

Known-bugs: 
1) we know that it is very slow
2) no other we are perfect.
